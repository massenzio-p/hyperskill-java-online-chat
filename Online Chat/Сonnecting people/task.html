<p>Improve the server so that it can handle more than one user. To make it possible for multiple people to join, you need multithreading. The main server thread should only listen to the incoming client connections. When a client is connected, the appropriate input and output streams should be handled in a separate thread so that they don’t block other incoming clients.</p>
<p>The task of the server is to count how many words the client sent. For each client, there should be a separate counter. The server should send the count back to the client. If the client types <code class="java">/exit</code>, both the client and the server should close connections and the thread should be finished.</p>
<p>The task of the client is getting data from the standard input, sending messages to the server, and printing answers to the console. If the input is <code class="java">/exit</code>, the client should send this message to the server, close the connection, and shut down.</p>
<p>Use the following template in the server code to handle multiple users simultaneously:</p>
<pre><code class="java">while (true) {
    Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
    /* create a new thread to handle client socket */
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is some information for future reference: socket connections are not secure, which means that anyone can read the messages between you and the server. To secure your chat, it's a good idea to encrypt the messages before sending them to the server. In addition, the server also should encrypt messages before sending them to the client. However, in this project, encryption methods are not discussed or applied.</p>
<ol>
<li>The input messages contain at least one word.</li>
<li>The client should print <code class="java">Client started!</code> at the start of the program.</li>
<li>The server should print <code class="java">Server started!</code> at the start of the program.</li>
<li>The server’s messages should match the following patterns:<br/>
	a. Client X sent: "message"<br/>
	b. Sent to client X: Count is N.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of each test, every thread you created will be interrupted. It may be in form of <code class="java">InterruptedException</code> or <code class="java">isInterrupted()</code> flag. You should stop your server in this case.</p>
<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should satisfy the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The server should be capable of connecting with multiple clients. Create a new thread to handle each client socket. Each client should be given a separate counter as a unique identifier like <code class="java">Client <em>numeric_identifier</em></code>.</li>
<li>The server should also be able to count the number of words sent by the client. The server should return this data back to the client but also reflect this in its own output. The server should output message length in the following format:                                          <code class="java">Sent to Client <em>client_number</em>: Count is <em>message_wordlength</em></code></li>
<li> When the client connects, the server should print <code class="java">Client <em>client_number</em> connected!</code>. If the client sends <code class="java">/exit</code> to the server then their connection should be closed and the server should print <code class="java">Client <em>client_number</em> disconnected!</code></li>
<li>The server should output messages sent by clients in the following format:                                                                                            <code class="java">Client <em>client_number</em> sent: <em>client_message</em></code></li>
</ol>
